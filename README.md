# Smart Grid

This repository contains all of the code for the work-in-progress research assignement called "Smart Grid". The smartgrid-website directory contains a django website, the serverTest.py contains mysql code that was written as a test for learning database management, and the SmartGrid.png/SmartGrid.xml are documentation (ERF diagrams) of the database. To create the diagrams I used draw.io (https://www.draw.io/).
